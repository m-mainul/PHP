	$dbpass = "secretpassword";

			mysqli_connect_error() .//determine actual error //retruns empty string if there is not a problem
			"(" . mysqli_connect_errno() . ")" //determine error no.

 	//2. Perform database query
 	$query  = "SELECT * ";  //always define a query in a seperate variable like that here we use the variable name $query. 
 	$query .= "FROM subjects "; //space is so important after each condition of the query otherwise query will be mismatched.

 												//Resource is collection of database rows that we can need to access	
 	//Test if there was a query error
 	if(!$result){
 			die("Database query failed."); //before we access the database we need to test the query is succeed or not.
 										  //if there is no result that means something wrong in the database query.
